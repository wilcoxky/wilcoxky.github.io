          <p>Hi my name is Kyle Wilcox, I am currently a fifth year senior at the University of Pennslyvania studying computer science and Chinese. During my first four years of undergrad I was a member of the Varsity football team. In the upcoming year I will be joining Venture for America, a fellowship where you get the oppurtunity to work at start up for 2 years. I am a very driven individual who is always trying to improve himself. If you'd like to chat feel free to contact me!</p>

                  <h1>Idea:</h1>
                  <p>Learning Chinese is hard, and for an introductory learner reading a full article is close to impossible. The number of known characters required to even pronounce every line is very high. Coming,
                    from a language with a roman alphabet, my prefered way to read Chinese, as well as
                    many of my peers is through piyin(Chinese romanization). The problem is that articles do not include
                    this and I often annotate the piyin above the characters. This is a painstaking process just to read one article and is not worth it to many people, especially beginners. Thus, the idea of Piyinator
                    was born. Make a tool that would allow users to to have an artcile in Chinese have its piyin annotated
                  automatically for you.</p>

                    that I enjoy but currently has a few issues in the world. Along with this, I have always been interested
                    in compture vision but never had taken a class on it before. The technology is rapidly expanding and
                    I wanted to see for myself how powerful it is. These all came together in my senior design that
                  analyzes a video of someone squatting and outputs to them faults in their form.</p>

                  <h1>Idea:</h1>
                  <p>Being a Varsity athlete at Penn, I realized that the way work outs were distributed to athletes
                    at all colleges during the summer was something that needed to be changed. Often times, athletes
                    were simple given a packet and expected to do it with little input from the coach. This led me and
                  my rommate, Dan Reardon, to come up with the idea of Athways, a workout distribution platform for athletes by athletes who know how the whole process works.</p>

                  <p>While many tools exist today to 
                  crawl the web, we were doing this from scratch in Java. The implementation had to handle all problems
                  that arise when scraping the web, such as traps and malformed html. The data was then sent to an AWS S3
                  and stored. </p>
